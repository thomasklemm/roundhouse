//! `EmitCtx` — explicit context object for rust emit state.
//!
//! Phase 1 bundled the two cross-LC class-method registries
//! (`GLOBAL_CLASS_METHODS` + `GLOBAL_CLASS_METHOD_DEFAULTS`).
//! Phase 2 lifted the four per-class thread-locals (`IVAR_TYPES`,
//! `CLASS_METHOD_PARAM_TYS`, `STATIC_METHODS`, `CONSTRUCTOR_FIELDS`).
//! Phase 3 lifted the seven per-method thread-locals (`MUT_VARS`,
//! `DECLARED_VARS`, `BACK_PROPAGATED_HASH_LOCALS`, `PARAM_TYPES`,
//! `LOCAL_VAR_TYPES`, `REBOUND_VARS`, `CURRENT_RETURN_TY`).
//! Phase 4 (this revision) lifts the five transient render flags —
//! `IN_CONSTRUCTOR`, `IN_CLASS_METHOD`, `IN_RETURN_TAIL`,
//! `IN_MODULE_SINGLETON`, `SUPPRESS_VAR_CLONE` — as `Cell<bool>`
//! fields. Cheap get/set, no `RefCell` overhead.
//!
//! Storage shape unchanged: `expr/mod.rs::EMIT_CTX` holds an
//! `Option<Rc<EmitCtx>>`; the existing accessor functions read through
//! it; the `with_X<F>(...)` wrappers swap field values on the
//! installed `EmitCtx` via save-restore rather than on dedicated
//! per-field thread-locals.
//!
//! After Phase 4 the only thread-local left in `expr/mod.rs` is
//! `EMIT_CTX` itself — the install slot. Every other emit state
//! lives on `EmitCtx` and is reachable from any code holding an
//! `Rc<EmitCtx>`.
