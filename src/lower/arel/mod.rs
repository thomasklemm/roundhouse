//! Arel IR — query algebra evaluable at transpile time.
//!
//! See `project_arel_compile_time_first.md` for the architectural
//! direction this implements. Phase 1 contains:
//!
//! - `ir`       — type definitions for the algebra (`ArelOp`,
//!                `Predicate`, `Value`, …).
//! - `visitor`  — `ArelVisitor` trait + `SqliteVisitor`
//!                implementation that turns an `ArelOp` into the
//!                same kind of `Expr` today's per-shape adapter
//!                methods produce.
//! - `build`    — `try_build_arel`: pattern recognizer that maps
//!                a Send call site to an `ArelOp`. Returns None
//!                for shapes the lowerer can't statically resolve;
//!                those route to runtime fallback in Phase 2.
