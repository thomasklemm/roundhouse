//! `<params>.merge(k: v)` where the merge is NOT on the permit chain.
//!
//! `controller_to_library::params` recognizes `permit(...).merge(k: v)`
//! syntactically and folds the merged keys into the spec's field list.
//! That only reaches merges written directly on the chain. campfire
//! writes the merge a method and a class away:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! # app/controllers/first_runs_controller.rb
//! def create
//!   user = FirstRun.create!(user_params)          # → UserParams
//! end
//! def user_params
//!   params.require(:user).permit(:name, :avatar, :email_address, :password)
//! end
//!
//! # app/models/first_run.rb  (a plain class, not a model)
//! def self.create!(user_params)
//!   administrator = room.creator = User.new(user_params.merge(role: :administrator))
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! So `role` never joined the field set, and the emit called
//! `UserParams#merge`, which doesn't exist — the whole first-run signup
//! died on it.
//!
//! **Widening the spec is not the fix here.** `UserParams` is shared:
//! `UsersController` (plain public signup) permits the identical four
//! fields, so it holds the same class. Folding `role` into the field
//! list would make `UserParams.from_raw` read `role` from the request,
//! and a signup form could POST `user[role]=administrator`. The merge
//! has to stay CALL-SITE LOCAL, assigned on the model after
//! construction:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! _pm0 = User.from_params(user_params)
//! _pm0.role = 1
//! administrator = room.creator = _pm0
//! ```
//!
//! Two things this needs that a local rewrite can't supply:
//!
//! 1. **Knowing `user_params` holds a `UserParams`.** Its declared type
//!    is `untyped` — nothing infers a parameter's type from its call
//!    sites. This pass proves it narrowly instead: scan every
//!    controller for `<Const>.<method>(…, <x>_params, …)` where the
//!    helper resolves to a spec, and bind that spec to the callee's
//!    parameter. Every call site must agree; one disagreeing site
//!    poisons the binding and nothing is rewritten. The proven type is
//!    then stamped on the method's signature — REQUIRED, not a bonus:
//!    a strict target can't pass an `untyped` into the `UserParams`-typed
//!    factory this pass calls.
//!
//! 2. **Statement position.** The construction has to become several
//!    statements, and a `Seq` left in expression position renders as
//!    newline-joined statements — `administrator = room.creator = _pm0 =
//!    User.from_params(...)` followed by loose lines, which binds the
//!    wrong value. So the prelude is HOISTED above the enclosing
//!    statement and the matched node becomes a temp read.
//!
//! All-or-nothing per site, and it fails closed: a merged key with no
//! writer, or a model whose resource doesn't match the spec's, leaves
//! the source shape in place and files a residue diagnostic. Emitting a
//! setter that doesn't exist would trade a named gap for a silent one.
