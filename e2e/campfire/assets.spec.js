// The first campfire browser spec, and deliberately the least clever
// one: it asserts that nothing 404s and nothing throws. No layout, no
// behaviour, no opinion about what the page should contain.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE. The room page pins ninety-five ES modules and links
// twenty-six stylesheets. Until `18e1601f` the build produced NONE of
// them — `make assets` in a campfire emit died on the blog's
// `hello_controller.js`, `app/assets/stylesheets/` was never walked into
// the tree, and eighty SVG icons were dropped because an SVG is text and
// the binary-asset collector only carries what is not valid UTF-8. All
// of that shipped behind a 200, a green 256/288 suite, and a green cable
// walk, because not one of those gates asks a browser for a file.
//
// A behavioural spec cannot replace this. When Turbo's import 404s, a
// locator waiting for a message row reports "expected 1, got 0" after
// thirty seconds; this reports `404 GET /assets/turbo.js` in one.
//
// It also stays useful after the current gaps close: an import map pin
// is a string in `config/importmap.rb`, and nothing but a browser ever
// checks that a file exists behind it.
