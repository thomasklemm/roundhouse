//
// NOT PARALLEL. Every spec drives ONE campfire, backed by one SQLite
// file that `database.yml` opens in `default_transaction_mode:
// immediate` — a single writer. Two specs posting messages at once
// serialize behind that lock in the best case and interleave rows in
// the room in the worst, and a room's message list is exactly what the
// behavioural specs assert on. The blog harness runs `fullyParallel`
// because its specs scope themselves to their own article; campfire has
// one room and every spec is in it.
