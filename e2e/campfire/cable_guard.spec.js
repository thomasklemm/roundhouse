// THE AUTHORIZATION GUARD, END TO END.
//
// campfire prepends `RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` onto
// `Turbo::StreamsChannel` for one reason, stated in its own source: the
// stock channel "verifies only the signature on the stream name. That
// name carries no expiry and no binding to a user." So a signed stream
// name lifted off a page you can see is, without the guard, a
// subscription to a room you may not be in.
//
// This is the walk's "the stock channel refuses the room's :messages
// stream" check (`scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb`), and it is the one
// check that must drive a RAW socket rather than campfire's client —
// the whole point is to send a frame campfire's own JavaScript would
// never send. `page.evaluate` gives us that from inside the origin, so
// the session cookie rides along exactly as it would for a real attempt.
//
// WHY THIS IS A MILESTONE PROBE AND NOT A LEDGER ENTRY. A failure here
// is a security divergence, not a missing feature: it means our emit
// subscribes a stolen stream name with no membership check. It was
// ledgered in docs/pipeline/runtime.md while the guard did not run at
// all; once the guard is in the path, a regression is a real defect and
// this spec is what catches it.
//
// A `confirm_subscription` here is the FAILURE we care about. A timeout
// is ambiguous — it could be a broken socket rather than an enforced
// guard — so the assertion distinguishes the two rather than treating
// "nothing arrived" as success.
