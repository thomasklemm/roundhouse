// THE MILESTONE, IN A BROWSER: two tabs, one room, one live message.
//
// This is the browser port of `scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb` — the
// cable walk. That script drives two raw WebSockets with a hand-built
// subscribe frame and reads the turbo-stream payload off the wire; this
// drives campfire's OWN client, and asserts the outcome the wire was
// carrying. Neither replaces the other, and the split is deliberate:
//
//   - The walk can assert things a browser cannot see — that the frame
//     echoes the subscription identifier byte for byte, that the payload
//     is an `append` rather than a `replace`. It also fails with a much
//     better diagnosis, because it names the frame that was wrong.
//   - This spec can assert the thing the walk cannot: that campfire's
//     own JavaScript — Turbo, Stimulus, the cable consumer, ninety-five
//     ES modules loaded from `static/assets/` — actually boots and does
//     the right thing with what arrives. A walk that is green while
//     Turbo never loaded is a walk that proves the server half only.
//
// WHY THE ARCHIVE SHIPS THIS ONE AND NOT THE WALK. The walk is Ruby, and
// needs `websocket-driver` and `net/http`. A downloader of the published
// archive has spinel, a C compiler and Node — no Ruby, and no gems. The
// browser is the only driver the archive can assume.
//
// Mapping onto the walk's checks, so a change to one can be reflected in
// the other:
//
//   walk check                                   | here
//   ---------------------------------------------+-------------------------
//   the account has a session cookie             | the per-run storage state
//   GET /rooms/1                                 | goto + response check
//   the room page carries a stream source        | the locator below
//   the page names the app's own channel         | the channel attribute
//   both connections are welcomed                | [connected] on both tabs
//   both subscriptions are confirmed             | [connected] on both tabs
//   POST /rooms/1/messages                       | submitting the composer
//   connection A receives the broadcast          | the message in tab A
//   connection B receives the broadcast          | the message in tab B
//   it is an append to the room's message list   | asserted INSIDE the messages list
//   it carries the message that was posted       | the body text
//   the frame echoes the subscription identifier | NOT OBSERVABLE — walk only
//   the stock channel refuses the stream         | cable_guard.spec.js
//
// `--unsigned` is expected in the stream name: the emitted tree mints
// unsigned stream names on purpose (the guard, not the signature, is what
// authorizes a subscribe — see cable_guard.spec.js).

// Unique per run: the archive database persists across runs, and an
// exactly-once assertion against a repeated literal would count the
// previous run's rows.
const BODY = `hello from the cable spec ${Date.now()}`

// Playwright's default is 30s for a whole test, and this one does more
// than any other in the suite: two sign-ins (the first of which completes
// campfire's first-run form and creates the account, the user and the
// room), two room loads of ~130 subresources each, two subscription
// waits, and a Trix interaction. The default is not a meaningful budget
// for that, and blowing it reports as "browserContext.close: Test ended"
// pointing at the cleanup line — which says nothing about what was slow.
test.setTimeout(90_000)

// THE MILESTONE, ACTIVE. This spec spent its first day as `test.fixme`
// over two defects it found itself: a ~30s second-client stall (a
// truncated /account/logo response the browser waited out — closed
// 2026-08-31) and the empty message body (the safe-list sanitizer was
// a raising façade behind campfire's `rescue Exception`, and Trix
// always submits HTML — closed the same day, twice: the sanitizer
// port, then the `h()` escape-exemption for the filter chain's
// product). The scripts/smoke campfire floor rose 3 -> 4 with this
// marker's removal; if this spec ever stops executing, that floor is
// what notices.
