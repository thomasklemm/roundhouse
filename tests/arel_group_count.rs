//! `group(:col).count` — Rails' grouped count — folds into the SELECT
//! and hydrates a Hash, on every target (issues #77 and #78).
//!
//! Three things had to be true at once for a grouped count to reach any
//! target, and none of them were:
//!
//! 1. `lower::group_count` renames the terminal to `group_count` (so the
//!    scalar `count` keeps its Integer return) and used to CLEAR the
//!    type. `analyze::diagnostics` reads `expr.ty` as it stands — it
//!    does not re-dispatch — so a typeless Send with a known receiver
//!    read as `send_dispatch_failed: no known method group_count on
//!    Relation[Comment]`, against a name the app never wrote, a runtime
//!    method that exists, and an RBS signature that declares it. Every
//!    target failed the type gate on a feature the pipeline ships.
//! 2. The Arel builder had no `group` arm, so no grouped chain folded.
//!    On the ruby-family targets that is a missed specialization; on the
//!    relation-less ones (rust, go, crystal, typescript, python) the
//!    fold is the ONLY path — they have no Relation to execute a chain
//!    on.
//! 3. The visitor had no Hash-yielding hydrate. Every result shape it
//!    emitted was Array-of-model, Array-of-column, a single record, or
//!    a scalar.
//!
//! The fold is licensed by the TERMINAL, never by `group` alone: a bare
//! `group(:col)` would render `SELECT * … GROUP BY col`, one arbitrary
//! row per group, which is not what any chain carrying it means. So the
//! builder recognizes the `group(:col).count` PAIR and declines
//! everything else, leaving it on the runtime Relation.
