//! `ActiveRecord::Locking::Pessimistic#lock!` / `#with_lock` (#644) were
//! unmodeled: the AR catalog had no entries for them, so `roundhouse check`
//! reported `no known method` on both, and the runtime defined neither.
//!
//! SQLite is a single writer with no `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, so `lock!`
//! reloads (the enclosing transaction already serializes writers) and
//! `with_lock` runs `lock!` then the block inside a transaction, answering
//! the block's value — same contract Rails documents, minus the lock
//! clause's actual SQL effect (the clause itself, `true` or a String, is
//! accepted — see below). Also covers `with_lock`'s Rails 8.1 shape:
//! a trailing options Hash (`isolation:`/`requires_new:`/`joinable:`,
//! Rails' `DatabaseStatements#transaction` keywords) separated from the
//! lock-clause argument, both forwarded to `transaction` rather than
//! raising `ArgumentError`. (Nested transactions — `with_lock` or
//! `transaction` called from inside one already open — still error on
//! SQLite; #644 made `with_lock` always open its own, which the corpus
//! doesn't yet exercise nested. Tracked separately, not fixed here —
//! see the PR thread.) Exercised on both the Ruby and Spinel targets;
//! the Spinel case is `#[ignore]`d like its sibling suites (CI's
//! `spinel-framework` job runs it with `--ignored` — see
//! `scripts/ci-plan.py`'s `SPINEL_TESTS`).
