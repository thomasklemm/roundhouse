# ActionDispatch::Request — the request-object surface controllers,
# filters, and helpers reach (`request.remote_ip`, `request.referer`,
# `request.xhr?`, `request.env[...]`, `request.get?`). Typed fields the
# dispatcher assigns from its transport (Tep under the spinel binary),
# not an env-hash bag — per-field types keep every read concrete under
# AOT. `env` remains as the one compat bag: lobsters reads
# `env["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]` and writes scratch keys
# (`exception_notifier.exception_data`), shapes the typed fields can't
# carry.
#
# Loaded explicitly by the spinel scaffold's main.rb (not from the
# action_dispatch require chain): the CRuby tree keeps its overlay
# Request (CGI-env-backed, runtime/action_dispatch_request.rb) and must
# not blend the two shapes.

  # (`request.body.rewind; request.body.read.force_encoding("UTF-8")`),
  # and a String answers none of that. The bytes tep read are the
  # storage; this is the cursor over them, the subset of Rack's input
  # (`StringIO` under CRuby, whose overlay twin hands back exactly that)
  # a controller reaches: `rewind`, `read`, `string`, `size`, `eof?`.

  #
  #   Current.set request: ActionDispatch::TestRequest.create("HTTP_HOST" => "once.campfire.test")

  # ONE PER REQUEST SHAPE, which is why this is not in the shared test
  # harness: the two ruby-family trees run genuinely different Request
  # classes (see the header of `runtime/action_dispatch_request.rb`, the
  # CRuby overlay's env-backed twin, which carries its own `create`).
  # This one is the accessor-backed class below, so `create` maps the

  # reader that wants them can still find them, exactly as Rails would.
