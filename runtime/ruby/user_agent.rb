# `useragent` 0.16.11 and `platform_agent` 1.0.1, ported.
#
# campfire reaches these on EVERY room page, which is not what the
# façade they replace assumed. `app/views/rooms/involvements/_bell
# .html.erb` renders `pwa/_browser_settings`, `pwa/_system_settings` and
# `pwa/_install_instructions`, and each of those asks
# `ApplicationPlatform` which browser and which OS. The stub raised
# `NotImplementedError` from `PlatformAgent.new`, so `/rooms/1` was a
# 500 on the spinel binary — the first page after sign-in.
#
# PORTED, NOT DERIVED (see the IPAddr port for the same rule). The
# classification rules below are the gems' own, transcribed, and the
# suite beside this file compares them against the real gems over a
# user-agent corpus rather than against hand-written expectations. Two
# results are surprising enough that deriving them would have got them
# wrong:
#
#   * a MODERN Edge (`Edg/140.0.0.0`) reports its browser as **Chrome**.
#     `Browsers::Edge.extend?` tests `product == "Edge"`, and the modern
#     token is `Edg`. So campfire's `edge?` is false on current Edge and
#     true only on the legacy `Edge/13.10586` spelling.
#   * Firefox on iOS (`FxiOS/126.0`) reports **Safari**, because iOS
#     Firefox is WebKit and `Browsers::Webkit` claims it first.
#
# Both are the gem's behaviour, so both are campfire's behaviour on
# Rails, and reproducing them is the point.
#
# NO `method_missing`. The gems lean on it hard — `Browsers::Base`
# answers any product name as a method, and `Chrome#browser` is
# `ChromeBrowsers.detect { |b| respond_to?(b) }`. That is unreachable
# for a static target (see the runtime's own rule) and it is also just
# a product lookup, so it is spelled as one here.
#
# NOT an `Array` subclass either, for the same reason: the gem's
# `Browsers::Base < Array` is how `detect` reaches the tokens, and a
# subclass of a builtin container is a shape the strict targets do not
# carry.
