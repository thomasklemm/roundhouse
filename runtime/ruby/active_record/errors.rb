  # RAISED BY EACH `Db`, not from here: the emitted per-model
  # `_adapter_insert` hands its SQL straight to the per-target `Db.exec`
  # primitive, and that is the only place holding the driver's error.
  # The three ruby-family `Db`s (`db.rb`, `db_cruby.rb`, `db_jruby.rb`)
  # each map it in `exec`, keyed on SQLITE'S OWN message text — "UNIQUE
  # constraint failed: <table>.<column>" comes out of the engine, so the
  # same string appears in the cruby gem's ConstraintException, in the
  # JDBC SQLException and in `sqlite3_errmsg`. The strict targets carry
  # their own `Db` and owe their own mapping.
