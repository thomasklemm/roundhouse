# Framework-level test bootstrap. Loads the framework Ruby (under
# `runtime/ruby/`). Runs under stock CRuby — no spinel, no transpile,
# no app fixture. Tests check framework-source correctness; transpile-
# correctness is a separate concern handled by per-target tests.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby -Iruntime/ruby runtime/ruby/test/<area>/<thing>_test.rb
# Or via the Rakefile under runtime/ruby/.
#
# Each test file requires this helper, then defines test classes
# that subclass Minitest::Test.
#
# Historical note: prior to <session date> this helper also defined a
# `FrameworkTestAdapter` module — a polymorphic Hash-backed in-memory
# adapter exercised by `runtime/ruby/test/active_record/base_test.rb`.
# That mock has been removed because its `Hash[String, untyped]` shape
# didn't survive spinel monomorphization, and the per-target mirror
# files (`runtime/{crystal,rust,go/v2}/framework_test_adapter.*`) plus
# the TS singleton in `runtime/typescript/juntos.ts` were proliferating
# adapter scaffolding for a single test. A follow-on session will
# re-enable base_test wired against each target's real sqlite adapter
# (CRuby: sqlite3 gem; spinel: libsqlite3 FFI; Crystal: DB::SQLite3;
# TS: better-sqlite3 / libsql; Rust: rusqlite; Go: modernc.org/sqlite).

# `Rails::GlobalID#to_param` and the signed-id verifier both use, and a
# suite that never loaded the shipped one could not have caught either.
#
# TWO CANDIDATES because two harnesses run this file and their layouts
# differ: the source-side gate reads it out of `runtime/spinel/`, and
# `tests/framework_tests_ruby.rs` stages a scratch tree in the EMITTED
# shape, where it sits beside the other framework files (the same swap
# that file already performs for `message_digest`). Whichever exists is
