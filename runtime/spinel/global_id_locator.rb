# `GlobalID::Locator.locate` — the READ side of the `gid://<app>/<Model>/<id>`
# identifier `GlobalID.param` mints in runtime/ruby/rails.rb.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND THE MINT IS THERE. The mint prices every target: a
# page renders `<turbo-cable-stream-source signed-stream-name="…">`
# whatever the runtime underneath it, so `GlobalID.param` transpiles
# eight ways. Locating prices only the lanes that have a subscribe path
# to run it on — a channel turning a stream name back into a record —
# and that is the spinel/ruby pair. Splitting them costs a drift risk
# (an encoder and a decoder in different files), which is why
# `tests/overlay_cable_dispatch.rb` round-trips `GlobalID.param`
# THROUGH this file rather than asserting either half against a literal.
#
# `only:` IS REQUIRED, AND IT IS THE FINDER. globalid 1.3.0 treats it as
# a filter and reflects the model name into a constant:
#
#   def locate(gid, options = {})
#     gid = GlobalID.parse(gid)
#     ... find_allowed?(gid.model_class, options[:only]) ... gid.find
#   end
#
# `gid.model_class` is `model_name.constantize`, and a constant computed
# from a wire string is the shape this pipeline will not emit — it is
# also the shape that lets a crafted name name any class in the process.
# So the caller's `only:` is what the record is found ON, and the model
# name in the URI is checked AGAINST it rather than resolved. campfire's
# one call site already passes it (`GlobalID::Locator.locate gid_param,
# only: Room`), so this is a narrowing of an API nobody used the wide
# half of, not a reinterpretation of the call.
#
# NIL for anything that is not one of OUR names — a truncated param, a
# different app's gid, a gid naming another model. `RecordNotFound` for
# a well-formed name whose record is gone, because that is `find`'s
# contract and campfire's `room_from` rescues exactly it.

    # THE GENERIC FORM, AND THE ONE A STRICT TARGET CANNOT RUN. `only`
    # arrives as a class OBJECT, so `only.name` and `only.find` need a
    # singleton to dispatch through; spinel has none and emits a call to
    # a class method `ActiveRecord::Base` never defines
    # (matz/spinel#4217). `lower::global_id_locate` rewrites every call
    # site whose `only:` is a literal class — which is all of them in
    # the corpus — to one of the generated `locate_<model>` entry points
    # below, so on a strict target nothing reaches this body and it is
    # not emitted. It stays for the Ruby lanes, where a class object
    # dispatches, and as the honest answer for a COMPUTED `only:`: that
    # call is left alone and refused at compile time rather than
    # rewritten to find on a class the caller did not name.
