# Cable — Action-Cable-shape WebSocket endpoint for the CRuby target.
#
# ARCHITECTURE. One reactor thread owns every connection: a single
# NIO::Selector multiplexes all sockets, and that same loop's select
# timeout drives the shared heartbeat. Puma request threads never touch
# a socket, a driver, a monitor or a subscription table — they post a
# closure onto the reactor's queue and return immediately.
#
# This mirrors Action Cable's own layering (StreamEventLoop's single
# nio4r thread plus one server-wide BEAT_INTERVAL timer) rather than the
# thread-per-connection shape this file used to have. That shape cost
# 2N OS threads for N connections — one blocking on readpartial, one
# sleeping between pings — and, worse, fanned a broadcast out on the
# PUMA THREAD that triggered it: `POST /rooms/1/messages` into a room
# with 1,000 subscribers did 1,000 JSON encodings and 1,000 BLOCKING
# socket writes before it could return 200, so one wedged client stalled
# both the broadcast and the request behind it.
#
# The fan-out inversion is borrowed from the spinel target's cable.rb,
# which publishes one composed envelope to a stream topic instead of
# walking connection objects: `Registry.deliver` encodes the message
# once and reuses the frame across every subscriber sharing an
# identifier (for Turbo streams, all of them).
#
# Deliberate differences from Action Cable, and why:
#
#   * The heartbeat rides the selector's own select timeout rather than
#     a Concurrent::TimerTask. One less thread, one less dependency,
#     same 3-second cadence.
#   * There IS a worker pool, and it is small. A subscribe now runs the
#     app's own `subscribed` — `RoomMessagesChannel` resolves a GlobalID
#     and asks `user.rooms.find_by`, campfire's `PresenceChannel` WRITES
#     — so a subscribe is arbitrary app code holding a database handle,
#     and running it on the reactor thread would let one slow query stall
#     every other connection's frames. Ping and delivery stay on the
#     reactor; only app code moves.
#   * The pool shares `Db`'s connection pool with Puma's threads, so
#     `CABLE_WORKERS` above `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` buys queueing inside
#     `Db.with_connection` rather than concurrency. Against
#     `default_transaction_mode: immediate` SQLite there is one writer
#     whatever either number says.
#   * A connection whose outbound buffer passes MAX_BUFFER_BYTES is
#     closed. Action Cable buffers without a ceiling; here one client
#     that stops reading would otherwise be unbounded memory.
#
# THREADING CONTRACT, in one line: everything below runs on the reactor
# thread except `Reactor.post`, `Reactor.attach`, `Registry.broadcast`
# and the `Workers` pool. That is why SUBS and the connection table
# carry no mutex — they have exactly one writer.
#
# The pool is the one place that breaks the single-thread rule, and it
# is fenced: a worker only ever touches the CHANNEL OBJECT it was handed
# (which nothing else has a reference to yet) and hands its answer back
# through `Reactor.post`. No worker reads SUBS, the connection table, a
# driver or a socket.
#
# Single-worker only. Clustered Puma (workers > 1) needs an inter-worker
# pubsub — Redis in campfire's own deployment — behind the same
# `Broadcasts.set_transport` seam this file plugs into.

  # The pool that runs APP code.
  #
  # A subscribe frame ends in the app's own `subscribed`, which queries
  # (and in campfire's `PresenceChannel`, writes) — arbitrary work
  # holding a database handle. Action Cable hands each inbound frame to a
  # worker for exactly this reason, and the reason survives the rest of
  # this file's departures from it: the reactor thread is the one thread
  # every OTHER connection's frames go through.
  #
  # FIXED SIZE, NOT ELASTIC. The bound that matters is `Db`'s connection
  # pool, not this queue: a fifth worker on a three-handle pool parks
  # inside `Db.with_connection` instead of doing work. Sized from the
  # same env var Puma reads, so the two move together, and overridable
  # for a benchmark that wants to see the difference.
  #
  # NO PER-CONNECTION ORDERING, deliberately and like Rails: two
  # subscribe frames from one client may settle in either order. They
  # carry different identifiers and register different streams, so the
  # order is not observable — what WOULD be observable is a subscribe
  # racing its own unsubscribe, which `Connection#channels` serializes by
  # only ever being mutated on the reactor thread.
  #
  # An exception in app code is caught at the boundary: it becomes a
  # rejected subscription, not a dead worker. A pool that shrinks by one
  # every time a channel raises is the failure that takes hours to see.
