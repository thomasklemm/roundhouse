# CRuby-only ActionDispatch::Request over the CGI env.
#
# The request-object surface controllers and filters reach
# (`request.remote_ip`, `request.referer`, `request.xhr?`,
# `request.env[...]=`, `request[:format]`). Built straight from the
# CGI/1.1 env hash the dispatcher already receives — no Rack. Lives on
# the CRuby overlay next to CookieJar: 8 targets don't exercise a
# request object yet, and per the CRuby-first strategy each target
# grows its own when its lobsters turn comes.
#
# `[]` delegates to the request params (Rails: `request[:format]` ==
# `params[:format]`), so the dispatcher hands the merged params in
# alongside the env. `env` is a plain mutable Hash copy — callers
# write scratch keys into it (`exception_notifier.exception_data`),
# which the real ENV object would reject for non-String values.
