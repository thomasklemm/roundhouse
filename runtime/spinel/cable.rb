# Cable — Action Cable (actioncable-v1-json) WebSocket endpoint for the
# spinel target, built on the Tep::WebSocket codec + Tep::Broadcast fan-out
# under Tep::Server::Threaded.
#
# This is the spinel-subset sibling of the CRuby overlay's
# `ruby_overlay/cable.rb` (which rides Puma's rack-hijack +
# websocket-driver gem). Both satisfy the same surface — Turbo's
# `<turbo-cable-stream-source>` opens a WebSocket to `/cable`, and
# `Broadcasts.set_transport(...)` fans model after-commit fragments out
# to subscribers in real time — but this one uses no gems: the
# connection is a green thread that parks between frames, the
# Tep::WebSocket codec frames the traffic, and Tep::Broadcast does the
# per-connection fan-out.
#
# Protocol implemented (Action Cable v1 JSON):
#   - Server -> client {"type":"welcome"} on open
#   - Server -> client {"type":"ping","message":<unix-ts>} every 3s
#     (ONE heartbeat thread for the process, walking a registry of open
#     connections -- Action Cable's shape, and see `Cable.register` for
#     why it is not a thread per connection; Turbo reconnects without it)
#   - Client -> server {"command":"subscribe","identifier":"<json>"}
#     where the identifier JSON carries
#     {"channel":"Turbo::StreamsChannel","signed_stream_name":"<sig>"}
#   - Server -> client {"identifier":"<json>","type":"confirm_subscription"}
#   - Server -> client {"identifier":"<json>","message":"<turbo-stream>"}
#     when Broadcasts.record fires on a subscribed stream
#
# Single-worker only (WORKERS=1): subscriptions + the broadcast log
# live per-process, so cross-worker fan-out would need the (dropped) PG
# backend. The model after-commit hook and the WebSocket connections
# run in the same worker, so in-process delivery reaches every client.
module Cable
  # The stream-topic -> identifier-JSON map lives on Tep::APP
  # (Tep::APP.cable_identifiers), not a Cable constant: spinel types a
  # Tep.str_hash ivar as StrStrHash but mistypes a module-level
  # constant initialised the same way as int. The identifier is echoed
  # verbatim in confirm_subscription + every broadcast message so Turbo
  # routes the frame to the right stream-source.

  PING_INTERVAL = 3   # seconds — matches Action Cable's default

  # How many pieces one interval's beats are sent in. See `beat_cycle`:
  # every connection is still pinged once per interval, but N frames do
  # not leave together.
  BEAT_SLICES = 10

  # THE APP'S OWN `ApplicationCable::Connection`, built against the
  # handshake's cookie jar — or an anonymous one when the app declares
  # no connection class. The factory itself lives in
  # `runtime/action_cable.rb` (`ActionCable::Connection.build`, a
  # generated arm) beside the class it builds, because the test harness
  # builds the same object: a `Connection::TestCase` runs the app's
  # `connect` against a jar it seeded, and one factory per tree is what
  # keeps the connection slot one class per tree (below).
  #
  # ONE RETURN TYPE PER TREE, which is why `WsMessage#initialize` builds
  # its placeholder through here too rather than naming the base class
  # directly: two spellings would make the handler's connection slot
  # poly for no gain: a base class is a union point, and a slot with
  # two spellings in it is one the emitter can no longer monomorphize.
  def self.build_connection(cookies)

  # Resolve the handshake's identity by running the APP's own `connect`.
  #
  # WHY THE APP'S CODE AND NOT A COOKIE LOOKUP HERE: `connect` is where
  # an app decides who is on the other end, and every app decides it
  # differently. campfire's reads `cookies.signed[:session_token]` and
  # loads a `Session`; reimplementing that here would hardcode one app's
  # authentication into the runtime and diverge the moment the app
  # changed it. The runtime's job is to hand `connect` a real signed
  # cookie jar and to honour its verdict — and the jar is the SAME
  # `ActionController::CookieJar` over the SAME `req.cookies` that
  # `Main.dispatch` builds for a controller, because a WebSocket upgrade
  # IS an ordinary HTTP GET and carries the same `Cookie:` header.
  #
  # Returns nil when the app refused. The caller answers that with a
  # status, which is only possible because identity resolves BEFORE
  # `res.start_websocket` — a socket already handed to the recv loop
  # could be closed but not given a reason.
  #
  # No DB lease is taken here: `connect` loads a `Session`, and
  # `Tep::App#dispatch`'s `Db.with_connection` already wraps the whole
  # dispatch, cable branch included.

  # THE CHANNEL A SUBSCRIBE FRAME NAMES — `ActionCable::Channel.build`,

  #
  # THIS IS WHERE AUTHORIZATION HAPPENS, and the reason item 4 is a

  # prepends `RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` onto `Turbo::StreamsChannel`,
  # and a prepended module only runs if something calls the method it
  # wraps. The frame used to be decoded here and subscribed directly,
  # so `subscribed` never ran and the guard sat in the tree unreached —
  # whoever could spell a stream name got its fan-out.
  #
  # THE CHANNEL DECIDES THE STREAMS, not this method. `subscribed` calls
  # `stream_from`/`stream_for`, which record on the channel; the loop
  # below registers what it recorded. A channel that authorizes and then
  # subscribes to nothing is confirmed with zero streams, which is what
  # Rails does — the confirmation says "your subscription exists", not
  # "you will receive something".
  #
  # A REJECTION IS A FRAME, not a silence. Action Cable's client keys
  # its subscription table on the identifier and retries a subscription
  # it never heard back about, so a dropped frame is a reconnect loop.

    # The client is told the subscription was rejected; stderr is the
